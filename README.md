I used intellij IDE.

To run the tests, just put @Test on top of the test call you want to run in the Demoblaze class(/automation-challenge-accenture/src/test/java/TestCases/Demoblaze.java) in the TestCases folder and Run "Demoblaze"

The result will appear in the console of the IDE screen.

In Utilities folder I created two files Driver to choose which browser you want to open and ActionsMethods to facilitate the finding of elements for clicks and form, so it's also possible to define the way you want to pass the element, for example by id or by xpath. Also set a Wait time.
